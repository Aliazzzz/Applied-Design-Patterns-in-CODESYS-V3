If you’re familiar with PC programming in languages like Java or C#, then you’ll probably know about the books Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. These books are about Software Design Patterns.

This list of ladder logic programming patterns serves two purposes: 

first, each pattern is a tool for solving a common problem using ladder logic, and having these patterns in your toolbox will allow you to program faster and spend more time focusing on the higher level structure of your program. 

Second, since these are common patterns, you’ll start to find it easier to read other people’s ladder logic, and other experienced programmers will find it easier to follow your logic.
